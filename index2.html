<p>The "Georgian Dream" exceeded the threshold, as they always did than they did.
    The anti-LGBT law was passed, again and again by those 84 pigs.
    We believe that the murder of Keso Abramidze is related to the adoption of this law, and thus Parliament is trying to show us that the LGBT community is a terrorist and ILLEGAL.
    For love, love is love.
    The Renaissance expresses full support for LGBT community.</p>
