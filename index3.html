    <h1>no to russian law</h1>
    <p>Thousands of people demonstrated in the Georgian capital Tbilisi on Monday demanding the withdrawal of a controversial "foreign influence" bill they say is inspired by authoritarian laws neighbouring Russia uses to crush dissent.

        "No to the Russian law," chanted thousands of protesters outside parliament, many waving EU and Georgian flags.
        
        A previous attempt by the government to introduce a "foreign agents" bill was abandoned in the face of mass street protests last year.
        
        But this month, the government announced it would reintroduce the legislation, renaming it a bill on the "transparency of foreign influence."
        
        Outside parliament, 23-year old Marisha said: "We are fighting for our freedom," as she held a long stick with the Georgian flag hoisted on top.
